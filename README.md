# crAssphage

Sequencing and analysis of crAssphage regions from around the globe

This is a repository of DNA sequences, analysis, and other information for the global crAssphage project. 
We have developed this site as a common resource for everyone to add sequences, get sequences from, and see our 
alignments and analyses. If you want to become a collaborator and add data to the repository, please contact Rob 
Edwards. If you want to just take the data and analyze it, you can clone this whole data set using `git clone 
https://github.com/linsalrob/crAssphage.git`.

All of the data here is provided under the MIT License. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you 
include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software, source code, data, or other parts
of the repository.

If you use this data or analysis please let Rob know.
